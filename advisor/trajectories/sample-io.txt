CS112(prereq=[],coreq=[CS101,MATH113])

edge case-- course is only required or available if a certain major is selected

# user enters courses they have taken
allCourses = [Every, Damn, Course]
coursesTaken = [Courses, Student, Already, Has, Completed]
requiredCourses = [Courses, Required, For, The, Major]
remainingRequiredCourses = []
nextCourses = []

# returns courses you have left for selected major
def remainingCourses(requiredCourses):
  for course in requiredCourses:
    if not in coursesTaken:
      course.append(remainingRequiredCourses)

# returns courses that have a Course as either a prereq or coreq
def allPrereqCoreq(course, remainingRequiredCourses):
  allPrereqCoreq = []
  for requiredCourse in remainingRequiredCourses:
    if course is a prereq or coreq of requiredCourse
      requiredCourse.append(allPrereqCoreq)
  return allPrereqCoreq

# all of the courses that have that course as a prereq or coreq
# I think that the recursive issue is fixed-- it doesn't matter if there
# are prereqs of prereqs because the class has already been taken
# furthermore, you're not going to have to worry about whether or not
# a course is 

# returns courses you CAN take given what you've taken
def nextCourses(coursesTaken):
  for course in coursesTaken:
    if prereqs in coursesTaken:
      append prereqs to nextCourses
    elif coreqs in coursesTaken:
      append prereqs to nextCourses
    else:
      append allPrereqCoreq(course, remainingRequiredCourses) to nextCourses
    return nextCourses

nextCourses is all of the courses it is possible for you to take next

once a user has selected the courses they want to take for the subsequent semester,
the tables will have to be updated accordingly?
(oh dear-- how shall this be done?)

this does NOT take into consideration geneds

# checks if you've taken a gened for a specific set of geneds (say, philosophy)
def genedCheck(coursesTaken, genEdCourses):
  diff coursesTaken, genEdCourses
  overlap?
  yay
# this might be problematic with courses where there are hierarchies, like science
# or languages, but for everything else, no need to worry about prereq, coreq

# users are able to select which courses they *want* to take for gen eds
# then pass the allCourses through allPrereqCoreq? NOT COOL
