PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
#############################################

CS112(prereq=[],coreq=[CS101,MATH113])

# user enters courses they have taken
allCourses = [Every, Damn, Course]
coursesTaken = [Courses, Student, Already, Has, Completed]
requiredCourses = [Courses, Required, For, The, Major]
remainingRequiredCourses = []
nextCourses = []

# returns courses you have left for selected major
def remainingCourses(requiredCourses):
  for course in requiredCourses:
    if not in coursesTaken:
      course.append(remainingRequiredCourses)

# returns courses that have a Course as either a prereq or coreq
def allPrereqCoreq(course, remainingRequiredCourses):
  allPrereqCoreq = []
  for requiredCourse in remainingRequiredCourses:
    if course is a prereq or coreq of requiredCourse
      requiredCourse.append(allPrereqCoreq)
  return allPrereqCoreq

# all of the courses that have that course as a prereq or coreq
# I think that the recursive issue is fixed-- it doesn't matter if there
# are prereqs of prereqs because the class has already been taken
# furthermore, you're not going to have to worry about whether or not
# a course is 

# returns courses you CAN take given what you've taken
def nextCourses(coursesTaken):
  for course in coursesTaken:
    if prereqs in coursesTaken:
      append prereqs to nextCourses
    elif coreqs in coursesTaken:
      append prereqs to nextCourses
    else:
      append allPrereqCoreq(course, remainingRequiredCourses) to nextCourses
    return nextCourses

nextCourses is all of the courses it is possible for you to take next

GEN ED REQUIREMENTS
#############################################

# I don't think even from a UX perspective that anyone would ever want to see all
# of the geneds that they could concievably take a subseqent semester-- there would
# be like eleventy billion of then

# checks if you've taken a gened for a specific set of geneds (say, philosophy)
def genedCheck(coursesTaken, genEdCourses):
  diff coursesTaken, genEdCourses
  overlap?
  yay

# this might be problematic with courses where there are hierarchies, like science
# or languages, but for everything else, no need to worry about prereq, coreq

# users are able to select which courses they *want* to take for gen eds
# then pass the allCourses through allPrereqCoreq? NOT COOL

BEYOND PREREQ COREQ
#############################################

"Through 200 level"

"At least 12 credits of xxx"

"One of "these" and two of "those""

"electives"

"take two sequences of"

OTHER THOUGHTS
#############################################

NO WAY TO CHECK ACCURACY OF USER INPUT
this is important for modifying trajectories-- see below

once a user has selected the courses they want to take for the subsequent semester,
this is saved as a trajectory
I take it then that each semester is its own trajectory?

how does one tell that things are broken when a trajectory is fucked up?
users can modify their trajectories, or particularly in comparisons
"do you have the prereqs and coreqs for everything now?"
or will it kill off an entire line of the courses
should only rewrite the trajectory of the furthest semester considered... then you
can not fuck up the other ones?

and then they should be able to share their trajectories so that it can be compared
with other students... --will need to implement later

should be able to point out "by permission of instructor"

also, what if the user input is wrong? answer: this system just assumes that it's right

needs to limit the number of programs that can be selected-- there already is one, implicitly
from a BA or BS selection, and then Honors?

UX
#############################################

User arrives on homepage, selects program, (Honors College?) and is prompted to select
already-completed courses.

User then is then displayed a list of courses for their major that they are able to take next.
Also displayed is are rectangles indicating whether or not each of the gen-ed requirements
have been completed.

If a gen-ed has not been completed, then they can select that button, which will retrieve all of
the gen-eds that they could concievably take for that particular instance.

The user then selects the classes that they intend to take for that semester.

This is then completed for each subsequent semester, until there are no more classes to select.

The user can save this trajectory.

What if a user wants to modify their trajectory? They can select to go back to any semester, but
it will delete their progress thus far for something.
