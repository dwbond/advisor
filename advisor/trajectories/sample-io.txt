separate the input into two list for ease

this is also better because you can mandate how many of each is required

OTHER THOUGHTS
#############################################

NO WAY TO CHECK ACCURACY OF USER INPUT
this is important for modifying trajectories-- see below

once a user has selected the courses they want to take for the subsequent semester,
this is saved as a trajectory
I take it then that each semester is its own trajectory?

how does one tell that things are broken when a trajectory is fucked up?
users can modify their trajectories, or particularly in comparisons
"do you have the prereqs and coreqs for everything now?"
or will it kill off an entire line of the courses
should only rewrite the trajectory of the furthest semester considered... then you
can not fuck up the other ones?

and then they should be able to share their trajectories so that it can be compared
with other students... --will need to implement later

should be able to point out "by permission of instructor"

also, what if the user input is wrong? answer: this system just assumes that it's right

needs to limit the number of programs that can be selected-- there already is one, implicitly
from a BA or BS selection, and then Honors?

UX
#############################################

User arrives on homepage, selects program, (Honors College?) and is prompted to select
already-completed courses.

User then is then displayed a list of courses for their major that they are able to take next.
Also displayed is are rectangles indicating whether or not each of the gen-ed requirements
have been completed.

If a gen-ed has not been completed, then they can select that button, which will retrieve all of
the gen-eds that they could concievably take for that particular instance.

The user then selects the classes that they intend to take for that semester.

This is then completed for each subsequent semester, until there are no more classes to select.

The user can save this trajectory.

What if a user wants to modify their trajectory? They can select to go back to any semester, but
it will delete their progress thus far for something.
