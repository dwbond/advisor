Advisor
===

SRCT Advisor is a dynamic web application that lets users create, compare, and save course trajectories towards graduation. Not intended as a replacement for formal academic advising.

On Contributing
---

Advisor is still in its very early states and needs all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel like you can be helpful the more technical aspects, we definitely need designers, technical writers, and testers.

There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing just a small spelling mistake.

If you need help at all please contact and SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn we are more than willing to help.

The project lead for this project is **Daniel Bond**. *dbond2@gmu.edu*

Please visit the [SRCT Wiki](http://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/) for more information on this and other SRCT projects, along with other helpful links and tutorials.

Setup
---

To get started, you'll need the following installed:

* [Python 2.7.3](http://www.python.org/download/)
* [Django 1.6](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)
* [Pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)
* [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html#installation)

Type the following commands in your terminal (if you're on Windows, [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) is recommended, or you can install a [virtual machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install a distribution of [Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) to it (select the 32 bit version).

(also, ssh keys...)

``bash``
``git clone http://git.gmu.edu/srct/advisor.git``
``cd advisor``
``mkdir ~/.virtualenvs``
``virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/advisor``
``source ~/.virtualenvs/advisor/bin/activate``
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
``create the database``
``python manage.py syncdb`` (the username and password are just for your machine-- you can set it as merely "me" and "password" if you like)
``python manage.py schemamigration trajectories --initial``
``python manage.py runserver``

Next, open your web broswer of choice, and go to http//:127.0.0.1:8000/. You won't see too much. You'll need to add the courses and programs to the database.

I've written some documentation in the docs folder about using the admin interface and creating some models. Use the same username and password you set up when you did the `syncdb` command.

To-do
---

**First orders of business**

* how do you make coreqs work? right now it assumes that a coreq has to come first, but that's obviously not how they work
* autocomplete js for the course name field (after a user puts in the department abbreviation and the course name
* scraping of catalog.gmu.edu for the database (this also means that with a single command everyone can be working on the same database :3)
* The student models needs to support the Django User Model
* Forms on the index and create pages need to submit information
* Forms on index and create pages also need to expand to an additional fields; also needs to take into consideration the max available
* does the create page need to reload in between submissions? I don't really know how that works
* LDAP auth
* Testing testing testing.

**Pipe Dreams**

* Making trajectories "public" within the system, so that they can be shared with other students.
* Making trajectories "public" outside of the system, so that they can be shared on social and messaging sites.
* Support departments to create sample trajectories for their students.
* Identifying if courses are available in the semester desired, and if so, getting professor information, CRNs, and what have you.
* An integrated "schedulizer"-type app for the classes that you've selected you want for that semester.

NOTE: A lot of musings about how the project will work are in a text file alongside the views and models. Please see if you can follow at all what I'm talking about.
